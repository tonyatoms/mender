# mender
A ReactNative version of the CityReportTool, a "personal itch" project. While numerous apps exist which let people report
issues to their municipial governments via their city's 311 API, none of them allow the user to store and resubmit reports. 
I submit the same three reports every few weeks and it is exceedingly frustrating to enter the same exact data over and over again.
We built computers and networks and networks of networks to save people from tedious tasks.

Mender might change its name. It might never see the light of day. At the outset it is just an excuse to learn ReactNative.
